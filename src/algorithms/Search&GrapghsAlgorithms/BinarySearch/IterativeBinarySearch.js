/**
 * Review
 *
 * In this lesson, you learned how to implement an iterative binary search solution.
 * The function returns the index of the target value from a sorted list.
 * If the target value is not found, the function returns null. You used the following steps to create this function:
 *
 *     Initialize the left and right indices as 0 and the length of the array.
 *     Create a while loop that continues to execute until the left index equals the right index.
 *     Get the value at the index that falls in the middle of left and right.
 *     Return the index if the value is equal to target.
 *     Set left equal to the current index plus one if the target is greater than the value.
 *     Set right equal to the current index if the target is less than the value.
 *
 * While the benefits of binary search are significant compared to linear search,
 * itâ€™s important to remember that the function will only work on sorted lists.
 * Instructions
 *
 * The gif below is a visual representation of the binary search solution that you implemented.
 * Compare this gif to the code in index.js.
 * You should see that indexToCheck is equal to the same numbers checked in the gif: 5, 8, 7, 6.
