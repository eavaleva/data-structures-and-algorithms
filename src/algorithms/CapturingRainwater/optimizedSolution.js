/** OPTIMIZED SOLUTION
 *
 * Weâ€™ll start by creating the following variables:
 *
 * totalWater = 0
 * leftPointer = 0
 * rightPointer = heights.length - 1
 * leftBound = 0
 * rightBound = 0
 *
 * leftPointer and rightPointer will start at the beginning and end of the array, respectively,
 *     and move towards each other until they meet. The algorithm is as follows:
 *
 *     while leftPointer < rightPointer
 *         if the element at leftPointer <= the element at rightPointer
 *              if the element is larger than leftBound, set leftBound to the element
 *              add the difference between leftBound and the element at leftPointer to totalWater
 * move leftPointer forward by one
 * else
 * if the element is larger than rightBound, set rightBound to the element
 * add the difference between rightBound and the element at rightPointer to totalWater
 * move rightPointer back by one
 *
 * return totalWater
 * */
